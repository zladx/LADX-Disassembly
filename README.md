# Links Awakening DX Disassembly

Disassembly of one of my favorite games. Taking it easy for now.

It builds the following ROMs:

- azlj.gbc (Japanese, v1.0) `
md5: f75874e3654360094fc2b09bd1fed7e8`
- azlj-r1.gbc (Japanese, v1.1) `
md5: 6d8f9cd72201caabdfd0455a819af9ce`
- azlj-r2.gbc (Japanese, v1.2) `
md5: 2e2596c008d47df901394d28f5bd66ec`
- azle.gbc (English, v1.0) `
md5: 07c211479386825042efb4ad31bb525f`
- azle-r1.gbc (English, v1.1) `
md5: ccbb56212e3dbaa9007d389a17e9d075`
- azle-r2.gbc (English, v1.2) `
md5: 7351daa3c0a91d8f6fe2fbcca6182478`

- azlg-r1.gbc (German, v1.1) `
md5: b0080c2f1919a4bb0ea73b788f4a6786`
- azlf.gbc (French, v1.0) `
md5: 1043fd167d0ed9c4094e3c9d8e757f1e`
- azlf-r1.gbc (French, v1.1) `
md5: 68242187b65166b5f8225b20e2021659`

Additionally, a wiki includes a [high-level overview of the game engine](https://github.com/zladx/LADX-Disassembly/wiki/Game-engine-documentation), and technical informations on the [data formats used](https://github.com/zladx/LADX-Disassembly/wiki/Maps-data-format) throughout the game.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3 and [rgbds](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds#1-installing-rgbds) (version >= 0.6.0 required);
2. `make all`.

This will build both the games and their debug symbols. Once built, use [BGB](https://github.com/zladx/LADX-Disassembly/wiki/Tooling-for-reverse-engineering#bgb) to load the debug symbols into the debugger.
