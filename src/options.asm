;


;
; Debug flag 1
;
; Effects:
; - Writes a pre-made save file to slot 1 on startup
; - Pause the game     (Hold a D-Pad direction and push Select to pause, push Select again to unpause)
; - Free-movement mode (Use the above (toggles at the same time))
; - Warp anywhere      (Push B + Select on the map screen to warp to the center of that room)
; - Dialogue debugger  (Marin will become a text-debugging object if your name begins with one space)
; - Jump to credits    (Marin will trigger the ending if your name begins with two spaces)

;DEF ENABLE_DEBUG_1 = 1


;
; Debug flag 2
;
; Effects:
; - Subscreen no longer redraws itself properly.
; - (JP only) Subscreen inventory doesn't update.
; - (JP only) Rupees and hearts don't update
; - Dungeon minimap entrance arrows aren't drawn.
; - Ending scene skipping (Left / Right during credits will move between scenes, Up / Down restarts)

;DEF ENABLE_DEBUG_2 = 1


;
; Debug flag 3
;
; Effects:
; - Free-movement mode   (Push Select on the subscreen to toggle)
; - Reset photo album    (Push Select on the subscreen)
; - Full photo album     (View the photo album to get all 12 images)
; - Jump to ending       (Push Start on the map screen)

; @TODO Patch effects and changes:
;
; __PATCH_4__
;   Changes ADD to OR one place, and removes the possibility to press
;   START to skip some part of the fisherman photo
;
; __PATCH_8__
;   1: Removes the debug feature that allows you to jump to the ending
;      by pushing START on the map screen if debug flag 3 is enabled
;
; __PATCH_A__
;   1: Skips updating the status bar's hearts, rupees,
;      and subscreen inventory if debug flag 2 is set.
;   2: Swaps the order of the subscreen and heart/rupee updates.
;      Purpose unknown.
;
; __DIACRITICS_SUPPORT__
;   Adds support for two diacritical marks on separate tiles above
;   letters.
;
; __SKIP_DIALOG_SUPPORT__
;   Pressing the B button will skip the remaining dialog and close the
;   text box immediately (for most dialog; some is marked as unskippable).
;
; __WEAK_GENIE__
;   The Genie (the boss in Level 2, Bottle Grotto) is weaker. The bottle
;   only needs to be thrown into the wall two times instead of three, and
;   the Genie himself has less HP.
;
; __RECALCULATE_MAX_HEARTS__
;   Makes sure the player's maximum health is legal by:
;   - clamping the maximum health between 3 and 4 when displaying the file menu
;   - clamping the maximum health between 3 and 14 before loading a saved file
;   - recalculating the maximum health to the actual, legal amount before saving,
;     based on map room flags for defeated bosses and collected heart containers
;
; __OPTIMIZATIONS_1__
;   Optimizations that were implemented in version 1.1 of the Japanese and English
;   revisions, and also in 1.0 of the French and German releases
;
; __OPTIMIZATIONS_2__
;   Small optimizations that were likely bundled in when adding diacritics support,
;   and so appear in the Japanese and German versions, but not any others
;
; __OPTIMIZATIONS_3__
;   Small optimizations that were implemented in version 1.1 of the Japanese and English
;   revisions, but not backported to other language releases
